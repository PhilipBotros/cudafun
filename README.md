# cudafun

A CUDA-based project for GPU programming and parallel computing experiments.

## Description

Exploring CUDA programming concepts and GPU acceleration techniques to better understand the inner workings of the latest GPU architectures.

Following the book: Programming Massively Parallel Processors (4th edition).

Highly recommend the book if you are interested in this topic.
